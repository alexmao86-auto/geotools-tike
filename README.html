Thank you for downloading GeoTools 2.6.4. This release was created on: May 17, 2010.

This release contains only a subset of the current GeoTools codebase. The full GeoTools codebase is made up of over 30 modules; Only the modules which are considered to be stable are included in this release.

For more information, and documentation on the GeoTools library please see our Community Wiki or the User Guide.

NOTE

The details contained in the rest of this file are provided as a quick start reference. For full details on requirements and build process please see the Developers' Guide.

REQUIREMENTS

To use the GeoTools libraries you will need:

    Java 5 or higher.


GeoTools will benefit from the inclusion of Java Advanced Imaging (JAI) and the Java Image IO (JIO) extensions in your JRE. In addition some formats require the ImageIO-Ext additions which explicitly support raster formats such as MRSID and ECW.

You can obtain the latest versions of both of these here. Detailed instructions can be found here.

ORACLE REQUIREMENTS

In order to use the Oracle module, you need the Oracle JDBC driver from Oracle. Unlike most external libraries used in GeoTools, we cannot redistribute this jar.

However, you can obtain them from the Oracle website, free of charge, after registering: - http://otn.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/content.html Please see the developers guide for more information.

BUILDING

In order to build GeoTools you will need a copy of Maven 2. Maven is a project management tool from the Apache group.

At the time of writing, the build process was known to work with the Maven 2.1.0 release.

Once you have maven installed, you can perform a full build by moving to the GeoTools folder and typing:

mvn install


Please read the Developers Guide for more information about maven:
